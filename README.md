Hello! I am a high school student enrolled in the Information Science Department. I have a strong interest in programming and data analysis, with a focus on learning Python. I am particularly drawn to AI and machine learning applications, and I enjoy working on personal projects and participating in competitions.

In terms of experience, I have taken on challenges such as â€”â€” and â€”â€”, putting a lot of effort into statistics and data visualization. My strength lies in understanding abstract concepts, and I aim to further develop my ability to explain them clearly.

My hobbies include music and game development, and I am working on creating a pixel-art RPG using Unity. Recently, I have been challenging myself to implement AI for "Gravity Connect Four" in Java. I also have a keen interest in photography and video editing, focusing on creating creative posts on Instagram.

My future goal is to participate in projects that use data analysis and AI to solve societal issues. Specifically, I am interested in economic analysis and regional revitalization projects us
